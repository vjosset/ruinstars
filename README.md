## Getting Started

To run the Ruinstars Companion App locally, you'll need:

- Node.js 18+
- MySQL database (local or remote)
- A `.env` file with your database credentials
- Seeded core game data (factions, gear, unit types, etc.)

---

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOURNAME/ruinstars.git
cd ruinstars
```

---

### 2. Set Up Your Environment

Create a `.env` file in the project root. You can start by copying the template:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file to match your MySQL connection:

```env
# Database connection string (adjust username, password, host, db name)
DATABASE_URL="mysql://user:pass@host:3306/ruinstars"

# Used by NextAuth.js
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

---

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

---

### 4. Set Up the Database

Generate the Prisma client and apply migrations:

```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

Then seed the database with core game data:

```bash
npm run seed:dev
```

---

### 5. Start the App

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the app on `http://localhost:5000`.
